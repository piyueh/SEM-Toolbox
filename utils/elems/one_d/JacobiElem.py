    For this element, the boundary and interior modes are

    i = 0, phi(x) = (1-x) / 2
    i = 1 to n-2, phi(x) = (1-x)(1+x)J(i-1, alpha, beta)/4
    i = n-1, phi(x) = (1+x)/2

    The construction of mass matrix is done by direct polynomial integration. So
    it's likely return very small floating numbers that are supposed to be
    zeros. Therefore, for common type of Jacobi polynomials, such as alpha=beta=
    0, 1, 2, it's better to use specialized class.
